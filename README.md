# Calorie-Logger-graphql
Is a project to Logger the calories per meal and show a graphic with all the info about the calories per day, week or month. This project I want to developed with NodeJs, Express, MongoDB and Graphql

### Create Mongo DB  
This proyect needs to run MongoDB Compass and a DB calls `calorie_logger`

### Before Run the project
You have to create a `.env` file with this data, please change your 

```
ENVIRONMENT=local

MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<mongo_username>:<mongo_password>@cluster0.qvpakql.mongodb.net"

MONGO_SAMPLE_GUIDES_DB="/calorie_logger"

JWT_SECRET = asd123
```

### Start server
Then you can run `yarn` or `npm install` to add all the dependecies, when the command finish, you can start the server with `yarn` or `npm` `start`.
